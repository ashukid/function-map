## Function Mapper

Input :
  Complete Path of the directory containing codes
Output :
  1. All the functions
  2. Where they're called

The aim of this tool is to simply project understanding. This tool will create a map with all the functions and where they're called, giving a overall overview of the project. Once we have the map, I personally found it very useful for understanding whole project and it simplifies as well as accelerates the whole process

Completed the first version of the code that displays all the functions and where they are called on
terminal.

run - `python main.py --parent_dir "directory_name"`


#### TODO :
1. Make it more modular
2. Add multiple display options
3. Add class detection and class method dectection
