## Function Mapper

The aim of this project is to make a tool which will take as input a directory with many files, and
tell me what are the functions in all those files and where they are called and display in multiple
ways.

Completed the first version of the code that displays all the functions and where they are called on
terminal.

run - `python main.py --parent_dir "directory_name"`


#### TODO :
1. Make it more modular
2. Add multiple display options
3. Add class detection and class method dectection
